# Philippine Standard Geographic Code Reference File
A cleaned-up version of the Philippine Standard Geographic Code that we use as a reference file for the location-matching app, LinkSight.

We are working with the PSGC published as of March 2018 on the Philippine Statistics Authority website: https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc/?q=psgc/search

We process the file using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks and publish the result as a `csv.gz` file.
